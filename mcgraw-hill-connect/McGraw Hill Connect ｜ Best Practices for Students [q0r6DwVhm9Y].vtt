Hi, I'm Philip Rice, McGraw-Hill Student Ambassador, and I'd like to take a moment to talk to you about a few things you're going to encounter in your new course.

1
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.640
As you can see, I've got a PowerPoint here. I'm going to run through that really quick, bring up to speed on a few items you're going to encounter.

2
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.560
And there's a few kind of best practices and tips at the end. But all these things are going to be things that you're going to encounter as a first-time Connect user.

3
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.760
So bear with me. I'll run right in it.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.840
So here's our agenda.

5
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.600
First, I'll give you a little bit more about me.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.400
What Connect is?

7
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.060
How do you register?

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.920
What are your purchase options?

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.860
Why use Connect?

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.880
And then we'll have a little kind of best practices at the end.

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.080
My name is Hope Rice.

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.260
I currently am attending Washington State University.

13
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.480
I'm getting my MBA.

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.400
And I've used Connect products quite a bit.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.120
I went back at another AA and I transferred that to Wazoo.

16
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.920
And I've used it a bunch.

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.200
I've used it for, I think, five courses now.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.980
And essentially it just saved me a 10

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
of time and I really believe in it and that's why I signed up to be a volunteer student

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.060
ambassador because I think that a good product should have good strong backing and I

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
want people to know how to use it and do well with it so what is connect let's

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640
talk about that for just a second it's basically it's a program that allows you

23
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.500
to learn in an adaptive environment it adapts to your performance and it

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.120
tailors your training plan if you will so you can use your time most

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:47.842
effectively and if you use Connect as you can see on this slide you going to get statistically a better grade So that a really good thing right if you going to spend x amount of hours studying why not get a better grade um so basically if you can see these bullet points basically it helps you manage your time you can do it anywhere um it gives you feedback so it adapts to you and where you

26
00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:58.722
you're you're supposed to stay organized all your stuff is right there in one area so it's a really cool program this is how you register um you're gonna you're gonna get from your syllabus usually

27
00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:06.102
You're going to get a link. You follow that link. It's going to take you right to the product. You can register. If you haven't bought it at that point

28
00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:09.202
It will give you some options of purchase and we'll go into that in a second

29
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.702
But if you have bought it you'll put in your registration code and you register for the course

30
00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:20.662
I'll show you what that looks like. You'll see this screen right here you put your registration code in there and hit submit

31
00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:25.902
If you need to buy it that's where you buy it and let's go

32
00:02:26.642 --> 00:02:28.782
to your options so you got all kinds of options

33
00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:34.982
right you can access an online and on your app and you can go in all digital

34
00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:40.862
if you want you can go just to connect I personally like to have a book and a lot

35
00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:43.682
of times your bookstore will have that bundle and that's a big savings you

36
00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:47.162
can save sometimes it's more than a hundred dollars if you buy them together

37
00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:51.962
so look in your bookstore and see if they have a bundle you can add on a loose

38
00:02:51.962 --> 00:02:56.402
leaf so if you bought just the digital product you can have them out on that

39
00:02:56.402 --> 00:02:58.782
loose leaf which means you can put it in a binder it's kind of

40
00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:01.002
convenient.

41
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:12.685
You put that information in there And like this right here it says order loose leaf copy and say boom And that a great great option it cheaper cheaper than the traditional hardback but if you want the hardback you

42
00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:17.644
can also you can see this option four over here you can go ahead and connect and get the bound

43
00:03:17.644 --> 00:03:22.685
print package it probably cost you a little bit more if you're like me you like the hardback

44
00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:29.565
i like having it and being able to refer back to it now i kind of already share my personal story

45
00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:34.285
but essentially what Connect allows me to do is not waste my time.

46
00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:36.685
I used to make flashcards, study questions.

47
00:03:36.944 --> 00:03:38.305
I used to quiz myself endlessly.

48
00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.165
I used to make all these myself.

49
00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:45.724
But essentially what SmartBook does, it has a quizzing feature that allows you to not have to do that.

50
00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.245
It quizzes you, and then it adapts you.

51
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.045
So if you're really strong in one point, I won't ask you those questions anymore,

52
00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:53.685
and it'll keep asking you the questions that you're a little bit weak in.

53
00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:54.724
So it's really great.

54
00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:57.745
It's exactly what I used to do, only I don't have to make the questions now.

55
00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:00.864
So that's my personal story and I really believe in it.

56
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:06.204
There's lots of information including this video you can go and you can find it on our YouTube channel.

57
00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:07.984
I'm not going to go into that right now.

58
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.745
It's a little bit more information than I want to get into.

59
00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:14.424
But the best practices are what I want to hit really quick.

60
00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:16.245
Don't wait until the last minute.

61
00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:19.964
What I recommend is just chip away at it, especially since you've got that quizzing feature.

62
00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:23.265
It's going to quiz you and it's going to figure out where you're weak.

63
00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:25.885
And then you can sign off and come right back in where you were.

64
00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:50.707
And you can see they say that middle builder point there Spent a little time each day I do that I wake up before I got to go to work and I spend at least half an hour every day just chipping away at it Most days it on smart book Some days it on other stuff But I recommend you do that either way That a good practice But if you do it with a smart book it going to keep where you were It going to know exactly where you were weak and where you were strong None of that information is lost

65
00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:55.107
And then there's some confidence questions at the bottom of each question.

66
00:04:55.707 --> 00:05:01.107
It kind of asks you how strongly you know this. So you really know it, you kind of know it, or you're guessing.

67
00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:06.387
I think there's four options. Be honest. Just be honest. You're not going to get great.

68
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:10.747
I haven't seen a course yet that grades you on it and you're going to give the smart book

69
00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:14.007
algorithm the best information possible to quiz you with.

70
00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:16.927
So do the best thing you can to just be honest with that.

71
00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:22.027
It's going to really get you where you need to go and tailor your learning plan.

72
00:05:22.027 --> 00:05:24.127
Now tech support, I can't stress this enough.

73
00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:27.407
Your instructor is not really the tech guy.

74
00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:29.167
Call tech support, use them.

75
00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.167
They've been really helpful with me.

76
00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:33.907
I've called them a couple times now and they've called me to get connected, especially when

77
00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:36.387
your instructor doesn't choose to use connect.

78
00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:40.727
you are using a McGraw-Hill book in a class you can still get Connect and I've had to go

79
00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:44.647
through tech support and they'll set you up and you can definitely use it.

80
00:05:44.647 --> 00:05:45.647
Definitely use them.

81
00:05:45.647 --> 00:05:50.407
I mean you want to focus your instructor time on content rather than some tech issue that

82
00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:53.047
your instructor may or may not have anything to do it.

83
00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:54.447
So use this.

84
00:05:54.447 --> 00:05:56.247
They've got lots of available hours in there.

85
00:05:56.247 --> 00:05:57.847
Really good about getting back to email.

86
00:05:57.847 --> 00:05:59.487
I've done that personally.

87
00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:02.127
So those are my best practices, my recommendations.

88
00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:05.927
I really appreciate your time and you know, use Connect.

89
00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:07.027
There's a good product out there.

90
00:06:07.087 --> 00:06:08.987
If you have any questions, hit our YouTube channel up.

91
00:06:09.347 --> 00:06:12.067
Again, use tech support and reach out to us,

92
00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:13.527
and we'll get back to you fairly quickly.

93
00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:14.387
Thanks for your time.
