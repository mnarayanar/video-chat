Welcome to Connectmaster. Your instructor has selected this program to help you study,

1
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.760
using an adaptive learning program that then applies what you've learned to real-world situations in your other assignments.

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.460
The assignment page summarizes the course content selected by your instructor,

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.580
and may include scenario-based activities, writing assignments and case studies, along with the adaptive assignments.

4
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.980
The assignment page also provides due dates for each assignment. Check the assignment page often to

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
stay on track with your work. Since the Adaptive Learning Program is a key component of

6
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.760
Connectmaster, let's take a quick look at what you can expect. As you answer

7
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.800
questions in your assignments, the Adaptive Learning Program will identify which

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.880
concepts you understand, in which you need to review more, with additional

9
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.860
resources like videos or slides. While this might be a very different way of

10
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.720
studying for you, it's also proven to be more effective and efficient. Here's how

11
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.980
it works. You can choose to start

12
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.840
by accessing content in learning resources or by assessing your knowledge with questions.

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.180
For some courses, topic overviews will introduce you to the content at the beginning of each

14
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.840
new topic or section.

15
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.820
As you answer questions in the assignment, you'll be given additional resources for the topics

16
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.880
you need more help with.

17
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.700
This will help you get more practice exactly where you need it in order to fully understand

18
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960
all of the key concepts your instructor wants you to learn.

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.980
Just keep working and let the adaptive program provide what you need.

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Start an assignment by reviewing the concept resources first, or by jumping straight to answering questions.

21
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you start with the resources, you can select what you'd like to learn about and click Go to Questions whenever you want to check your understanding.

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.465
To complete an assignment you need to show you understand all of the concepts included in your assignment As you work through the assignment your progress is shown by the bar in the upper left section of the screen

23
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:03.524
Your progress and that of your classmates will be reported to your professor so they know

24
00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:08.525
which concepts the class is struggling with and which are understood.

25
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.405
It's okay to get things wrong in the adaptive assignments.

26
00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:14.505
It's actually an important part of the learning experience.

27
00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:18.364
These assignments measure how much you practice and how many concepts you complete.

28
00:02:18.644 --> 00:02:22.485
not how many questions are asked, or how high your score.

29
00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:28.565
It's important to be honest in your responses and try your best in order to move forward and get accurate results.

30
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:35.765
So don't guess. Go back to the reading or use other study resources in the assignment to review concepts that you're struggling with.

31
00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:41.525
Because the assignment is adaptive, the number of questions you answer to complete the assignment

32
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:47.364
may be different from your classmates. We've given you a time estimate for the assignment to help you plan your work.

33
00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:50.725
There's no time limit, so you can spend as long as you want.

34
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:55.845
The progress indicator will let you know how many more concepts you need to complete your assignment.

35
00:02:55.845 --> 00:03:02.084
Most of your homework will be the assignments your instructor sets up, but there are additional tools available.

36
00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:04.725
Review assignments are assigned by the instructor.

37
00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:08.965
If this option is assigned, it's a good way to prepare for tests since your instructor will

38
00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:12.405
have specifically chosen what concepts are included.

39
00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:17.204
Recharge assignments are something you can assign to yourself, helping you design your own practice.

40
00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:21.525
This is a great tool to review concepts you've struggled with.

41
00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:26.005
You should pay attention to the reports on your most challenging concepts when you set this up,

42
00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:30.965
so you don't spend too much time studying what you already know.

43
00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:32.725
Now it's time to get started.

44
00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:39.885
We hope you have a great semester in this course, and if you have questions, contact our customer support, or ask your instructor.

45
00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:40.885
Good luck!

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:49.204
