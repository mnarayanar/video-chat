Connect definitely boosts your grades just because you do become a better learner.

1
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.720
You are studying more effectively and efficiently and you're more prepared for class.

2
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.080
You're able to ask more meaningful questions.

3
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.140
You'll get better answers, know how to study in the future.

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.080
So I think it's just made me a better student overall.

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.560
In the Smart Book, the highlighting and annotation tool has helped a lot in helping my grade

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.360
improve as well as the practice quizzes and the connect homework.

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.520
It really just keeps me on track with what I need to learn and how I need to learn it.

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.920
And that leads to better test scores and a better overall grade in many of my courses.

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.640
As someone who likes having a little bit of help here and there, it creates kind of like a

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.920
schedule for me, a mini schedule within my schedule that shows me what I need to do, what I need

11
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.540
to complete. And then I can either complete it or go the extra mile and

12
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.560
see what other things I can find and do as opposed to just doing what I needed to do.

13
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.560
And everything that I was looking for from, you know, assistance with outside tutoring companies,

14
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
I was able to get right from Connect.

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.560
I literally boosted my grade from a letter grade and a half.

16
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.560
Connect has helped me achieve my goals by helping me study, which helps me get better grades,

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.560
and therefore graduate college, hopefully.

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560
You know,
