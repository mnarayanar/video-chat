Hi, today I'm going to walk you through how to get registered for your Connect Math

1
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.480
hosted by Alex course. Go to connectmath.com and right here in the middle, click the Sign Up

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:21.000
Now link. Next, you'll need to enter the 10-character class code provided by your instructor.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.840
Confirm that the information displayed on this screen matches the course that you're trying

4
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.000
to enroll in. If it doesn't, you'll need to click cancel and check your class code again.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.460
If everything looks good, go ahead and click confirm to enroll in this course.

6
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.160
Now you'll need to indicate whether or not you've used Connect Math before. If you have,

7
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.960
enter your login name and password here. If you can't remember, just use the I forgot

8
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.380
my information link. I'm going to continue as a student who has not used Connect Math before.

9
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.840
Here, I'll enter my information as well as a valid email address that I have access to.

10
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.840
I don't need to enter a student ID because Connect Mac will assign one for me.

11
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
Agree to the terms and click Continue.

12
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.845
connect math has assigned for me I can change this later in my account if I like to

13
00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:43.145
Lastly, we either need to apply access that we've already purchased or complete a purchase

14
00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.445
here.

15
00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.325
I'm going to enter an access code.

16
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:52.865
But again, if you haven't purchased yet, you can do so directly through the ConnectMath website

17
00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:55.285
by using the I Need to Purchase an Access Code link.

18
00:01:58.525 --> 00:02:04.405
Here, I see when my access to this course will expire, and once I click confirm, I'm

19
00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:05.845
officially enrolled.

20
00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:10.405
I'm taken to the My Classes page, where I can manage any and all classes that I have in

21
00:02:10.405 --> 00:02:14.265
my Connect Math account.

22
00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:21.945
Using this light bulb up here, I can toggle these tips on and off.

23
00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:25.645
Here you see the course that I just enrolled in.

24
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:31.545
I can flip this tile over using more details to see all of the details for the course,

25
00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:32.665
or use this 3.

26
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:37.325
menu to take action needed.

27
00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:43.305
In order to continue to the course, just click on the title.

28
00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:52.565
You can return to the Manage My Classes page at any time to make changes you need to by using

29
00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:55.165
the Manage My Classes link up here in the top right corner.

30
00:02:55.645 --> 00:03:04.645
I wish you the best of luck this semester using Connect Math hosted by Alex.

31
00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:05.645
