Hello. In this session we'll be walking through how to take an existing

1
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.420
Connect course and reuse it for your upcoming term. We'll take our Spring

2
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.580
2015 section here as an example where we want to reuse all of the assignments

3
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.500
that we used in the previous term. In order to make an exact copy of this course,

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.320
we'll come over here to the section options gear icon. Click that and select a

5
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.860
duplicate section. Rename the section appropriately and click

6
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.400
continue to new section. Once your section is created you'll be provided

7
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940
with a new student registration information sheet which will contain your new

8
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.320
section web address for your students. Click continue to new section to see your

9
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.440
new section. Now I'm going to return back to my course home page.

10
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.320
and I'm going to add a blank section. To do that, you'll come to the course level and click the course options button and click add section.

11
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.320
Label the section appropriately and click save.

12
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.320
You will again get a new student registration information sheet with your new section URL.

13
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.320
You can continue to your new section but keep in mind this is a blank section because you created it from scratch.

14
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.320
Let's go back to my courses and talk about how you can take the assignments from your previous section and copy them into that new blank section.

15
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:44.320
So if I go into my original course here, I can select any and all assignments on the right hand side here,

16
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.975
come up to my assignment options menu and select copy I receive a pop explain the differences between sharing and copying

17
00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:57.975
In this case, we'll want to copy.

18
00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:03.975
I'll select my new blank section and click Copy.

19
00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:11.975
Whether you duplicated in an existing section or copied assignments from a previous section,

20
00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:13.975
you'll want to make sure you update your due dates to reflect the new date.

21
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:20.975
dates to reflect the new term. Let's switch sections and go to one of our new courses.

22
00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:26.975
In order to update the due dates, simply select the assignments on the right-hand side.

23
00:02:26.975 --> 00:02:32.975
Come up here to your assignment options menu and select manage dates.

24
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:39.975
On the first page, you can adjust the due dates for all selected assignments by clicking edit next to start and due.

25
00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:42.975
You can also adjust due dates individually by clicking individually in the top right-hand corner here.

26
00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:55.755
right hand corner here. Adjust the due dates appropriately and click save when

27
00:02:55.755 --> 00:03:01.915
you're done. In addition to adjusting the due dates you'll also want to make

28
00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:06.315
sure your registration dates line up with your new section. Click my courses to

29
00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:12.015
return back to your course homepage. In this case I don't have any date set but

30
00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:17.174
And if I need to adjust my dates, I'll come up here to my course options menu and select

31
00:03:17.174 --> 00:03:20.375
set registration dates.

32
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:25.755
The first page will allow me to select a start and end date for all sections in that course,

33
00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:31.795
or I can select specific sections if I'd like to stagger those out according to the section.

34
00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:32.735
Click Apply when you're done.
