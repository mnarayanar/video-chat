00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Your Connect course offers many different kinds of activities

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to ensure you achieve mastery of the important concepts.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One such assignment, McGraw-Hill's Adaptive Learning Assignment

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is an intelligent learning system

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that uses a series of adaptive questions

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to pinpoint your unique knowledge gaps.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As you work through the questions on the vocabulary

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and grammar presented in each chapter,

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.980
the adaptive learning assignment will

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
identify what you know and don't know and continuously adapt, focusing on the areas where you need help the most.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This allows you to learn and master core vocabulary and grammar at your own pace and results in being better prepared and ready to communicate in class.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
After you log in to connect, you'll see the adaptive learning assignment icon over on the right.

14
00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:13.672
and how many attempts your instructor has set. When you're ready to move forward, just click

15
00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:19.112
on the begin button. Remember, only work completed prior to the assigned due date will

17
00:01:25.992 --> 00:01:31.312
questions when you're ready to begin the assignment. Next, you'll get some assignment

18
00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:37.032
tips. Be sure to read these carefully. Each question requires you to do two

19
00:01:37.032 --> 00:01:42.552
things. First, answer the question by either typing in the answer box or selecting an

20
00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:49.032
option. The second part is to select your confidence rating for each question. That's at

21
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:54.872
the very bottom of each screen. If the question requires you to type in an answer, you'll

22
00:01:54.872 --> 00:02:07.225
also see a small keyboard that you can use to type accented characters As you submit each answer you get feedback from the software to indicate if you got the answer correct or incorrect

23
00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.485
You'll also get a little extra information

24
00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.405
if you got the answer incorrect.

25
00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.105
Notice the status bar across the top,

26
00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:17.605
which shows how many concepts you've completed

27
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:21.145
and how many more you still need to do.

28
00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:23.965
Also, be careful with your accented letters.

29
00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:25.485
This answer would have been correct,

30
00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:26.965
except that the accents were wrong.

31
00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:32.985
Sometimes you'll be asked to match items or select from multiple choice options.

32
00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:38.985
And if you need to take a break, you can exit the assignment and pick back up where you left off.

33
00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:43.985
You'll know when you have completed the entire assignment with this special screen,

34
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:50.985
giving you information about your progress, your accuracy, and the questions you had the most trouble with.

35
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:56.965

42
00:03:27.977 --> 00:03:34.857
of the same concepts. Notice that in recharge mode, progress is not measured and no score will be
