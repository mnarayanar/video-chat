When you log into your Connect course, the main screen lists your assignments in the center of the window.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This video gives you tips on successfully completing the homework assignments.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When you click on a homework assignment, a box provides important details about the assignment.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Click the blue begin button to start the activity.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The next screen is a summary of the details on this activity.

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.520
continue to move into the activity itself. The first question in this activity is Communication.

8
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.040
Notice that the points for this question are available over on the left hand side, and there's also

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.520
a link back to your e-book in case you need a reference to find the answer. Read the material in the

10
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.840
box and the table underneath, and then answer the questions below.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
For this question, select the correct verb from the drop-down menu,

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then type in the correct number to complete the sentence correctly.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you need an accented letter, the small keyboard icon will offer those options.

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Once you've answered, you can click the Check My Work button to get feedback on where you got answers correct and incorrect.

15
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So long as your instructor allows, you may make corrections before submitting for a grade.

16
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you need to take a break, you can also select Save and Exit,

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which allows you to complete this set of questions later.

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:49.045
Some activities may require you to submit for a grade without using the Check My Work option Go to the next question in this set of eight by using the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen

19
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:56.045
Once you have completed all eight questions, you can click on the submit button to send this to your instructor.

20
00:01:56.045 --> 00:02:00.045
Some items are automatically graded by the computer.

21
00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.045
Others require an instructor to review.

22
00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:09.845
Some activities, particularly those labeled WBLM or Workbook Lab Manual,

23
00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:14.644
may require you to record your voice saying the correct answer aloud.

24
00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:22.644
There is often a reference provided, so you can listen to the correct pronunciation first and then say it yourself.

25
00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:30.445
Similarly, some activities may require you to listen to the target language and answer questions about what is said.

26
00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:35.725
One thing to note, always read the directions for each question in the activity.

27
00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:42.205
Sometimes multiple answers are allowed. Sometimes you need to type your answer into the box.

28
00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:47.644
Sometimes you can select from a menu of answer choices. The directions will make it clear

29
00:02:47.644 --> 00:02:55.084
what you need to do in each case. One last suggestion. Don't forget to do your homework early.

30
00:02:55.084 --> 00:03:00.285
With so many fun and interesting exercises in Connect, you'll want to keep practicing.

31
00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.584
Enjoy the program and good luck.
