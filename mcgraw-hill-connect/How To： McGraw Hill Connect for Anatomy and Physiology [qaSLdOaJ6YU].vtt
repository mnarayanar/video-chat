00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
You registered for anatomy and physiology within Connect.

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
Now what?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Well now you have access to a variety of anatomy and physiology study tools that help you be more successful in the course.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And let me tell you, they're lifesavers.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
First, I want to introduce you to Learn Smart Prep.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This tool may or may not be assigned by your instructor, but don't worry.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Either way, you can use it to strengthen your knowledge of basic chemistry and basic biology.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Both are vital for the A&P course.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
With Learn Smart Prep, you'll be better prepared for anatomy and physiology and have a greater chance of succeeding.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Next, I want to introduce you to anatomy and physiology revealed.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We refer to this as APR.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It is by far the coolest and best study tool for A&P, and you'll find it right on your Connect home screen.

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We like to say that with APR, you'll peel the real deal.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The tool lets you practice from real structures virtually anywhere, anytime.

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.140
Simply click on the widget once in Connect to launch the application.

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.420
Once you're in the program, you'll be able to choose dissection, animations to watch, or even

16
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.260
take some self-quivis.

17
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.100
The dissection allows you to access the structures of the body in a safe environment and practice

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.820
as much as you'd like.

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.640
You are also given information about the structure, like what it does, where it's found,

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.600
even audio pronunciations.

21
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.980
You can even watch videos that will show you related actions or processes which

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.900
are related to the structure.

23
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.600
It's pretty straightforward and it's a great tool that's easy to use.

24
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.680
But if you get stuck, know that there's help videos for you on the home screen of anatomy

25
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800
and physiology revealed.

26
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.240
There you have it, you're registered and now you've been introduced to what awaits.

27
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.680
Good luck and make sure to take advantage of these one-of-a-kind tools.
