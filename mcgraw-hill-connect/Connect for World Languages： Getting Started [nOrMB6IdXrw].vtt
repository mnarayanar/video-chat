Welcome to Connect for World Languages.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Your instructor will make assignments for you through Connect,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and this short video will help you get started.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When you first open Connect,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
your screen should look something like this example.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Click on the word menu in the top left corner to access a to-do list

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with all your assignments and due dates.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can also see your assignments on a calendar or check your results.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At the bottom of this column, you'll see a link to Connect Support

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
where you can search for an answer to a question or get help via email, phone, or chat.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Click the word classes and then select your class to return to the main screen.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Notice the instructor information in the top left corner.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Just below that, under the word read, is your ebook.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can read here inside of Connect,

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or you can download the Read Anywhere app to read chapters offline.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In the middle of the screen, you'll see you'll see

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.962
the assignment section Every practice activity or homework assignment will appear here Notice there are folders with assignments grouped inside For this example you can see the instructor has a folder with

17
00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:19.602
all of the Capitulo or Chapter 2 assignments included. When you're ready to start working on a specific

18
00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:25.682
assignment, click on the blue arrow. You'll see information about the due date and other details

19
00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:29.602
about the activity. Click begin when you're ready to start.

20
00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:37.742
We'll look at the adaptive learning assignment entitled Capitulo DOS Vocabulario as an example.

21
00:01:39.242 --> 00:01:42.662
Adaptive learning assignments are like adaptive flashcards.

22
00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:45.962
The software adapts based on your performance.

23
00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:50.442
After you click Begin, you'll be asked a series of questions.

24
00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:55.262
Be sure to notice that in addition to clicking on the answer you think is correct,

25
00:01:55.642 --> 00:02:00.622
there is a second question at the bottom that asks how confident you are about your answer.

26
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.642
Be honest.

27
00:02:02.642 --> 00:02:19.985
The combination of your answer plus your confidence level gives the program information that allows it to adapt If you already know most of the material well you move through the questions more quickly Sometimes adaptive learning assignments may ask you to type out your answer

28
00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:25.285
If you need to type accented letters, a small keyboard will appear near the question,

29
00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:27.585
allowing you to select the letter you need.

30
00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:32.085
After you answer, the program gives you feedback on your response.

31
00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.985
Near the top of the screen, you'll see a progress bar.

32
00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:41.885
That shows how many concepts you've completed and how many more you'll need to complete to finish the assignment.

33
00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:47.085
